## Overview
This game is built using Phaser 3 and Typescript. Through my experience learning this framework, I found
the examples created by the community an amazing resource to learn from. With this in mind,
I've made the code open source here in the hopes that it helps someone else learn the
framework also.

* Node 10.x.x/NPM/Yarn
